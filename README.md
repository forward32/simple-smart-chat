I am new to Python.
It is my course project in university (BMSTU).
It is chat, but not simple chat. In this chat the server part and the client part is the one application.
So this chat has tricky work with network - there is the main server and other clients talking through it.
If main server is dead then all clients try to become the main server. The youngest client will be the main server.

So, in result, it will be anonymous*, because no one knows about other clients, and decentralized, because 
if one server is dead new server will appear. 

Developed on Python3
